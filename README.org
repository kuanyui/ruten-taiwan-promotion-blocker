* Introduce
This is a simple "Promoted Item" blocker specially made for Ruten, one of the biggest online shopping malls in Taiwan.

In these days (as of 2023/06), Ruten returns too many unrelated results (but has "promoted" badge) appear in your search results, which significantly decrease user experience. Sometimes the disturbance is so critical that even Google can easily find out what I want on Ruten, but Ruten itselves search system can't.

This extension is to try to improve such situation.
